which are the recursive questions in leetcode
ChatGPT
Recursive questions in LeetCode typically refer to problems that can be solved using recursive algorithms. These problems often involve breaking down a larger problem into smaller, similar subproblems and solving each subproblem recursively until reaching a base case.

Some common types of recursive problems on LeetCode include

Tree Traversal Problems involving traversing through binary trees or other tree structures using recursive algorithms, such as inorder traversal, preorder traversal, and postorder traversal.
Divide and Conquer Problems that can be solved by dividing the original problem into smaller subproblems, solving each subproblem recursively, and then combining the results. Examples include binary search, merge sort, and quicksort.
Backtracking Problems that involve systematically searching through all possible combinations of a solution space to find one or more solutions. Backtracking algorithms typically use recursion to explore different paths and backtrack when reaching dead ends.
Dynamic Programming Some dynamic programming problems can also be solved recursively by defining a recursive function to compute the solution, although this approach may not be the most efficient due to redundant computations. Memoization (storing the results of intermediate computations) or bottom-up dynamic programming are often preferred for efficiency.
To find recursive problems on LeetCode, you can filter problems by tags such as Recursion, Tree, Divide and Conquer, Backtracking, or Dynamic Programming. These tags are usually assigned to problems that involve or can be solved using recursive algorithms.
